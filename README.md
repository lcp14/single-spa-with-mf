Trying to use SingleSPA and module federation to build microfrontends with Vue and React


Not sure if the structure of the project is right... but i'm learning about single-spa and this code is my playground to work with this two microfrontend frameworks together (Single SPA and Module Federation) 

Came up with some problems that I try to solve, like with and App load a Bootstrap.css file , all my project will load the bootstrap css... I'll learn more about single spa to refine this project
